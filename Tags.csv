The Living Computer Museum, located in Seattle, Washington, is dedicated to preserving and displaying working examples of those computers that tell the story of our journey away from computing as a difficult and expensive undertaking toward the universal access to information technology we enjoy today. Although we have many stories associated with the history of our systems, we believe that the best way for people to fully understand computing systems is by experiencing them. Hardware alone cannot illustrate what it was like to use these machines. Software, information, and human interaction complete the experience. We celebrate the achievements of early computer engineers by preserving and maintaining running machines and original software, and making them available to everyone. Our goal is to breathe life back into our machines so the public can experience what it was like to see them, hear them, and interact with them. We make our systems accessible by allowing people to come and interact with them, and by making them available over the Internet. On any given day at the Living Computer Museum, you might see our staff working to restore our machines. That means returning the computers to their running state.

Neil A. Armstrong had done what no man had done before him. From his hometown of Wapakoneta, across the United States, and around the world, people wanted to honor his feat.The Apollo 11 crew had completed the greatest journey in human history putting men on the moon and setting the course for the future of the nations space program.The impact of that journey is still felt in Wapakoneta today. Businesses and streets in the community reflect the pride the city has in its native son, the first person to walk on the moon.On July 20, 1969, Ohio governor James Rhodes proposed a museum as a monument to the achievements of not only Armstrong but all Ohioans who have attempted to defy gravity, as well as to the history of the space program itself.After the state of Ohio pledged $500,000 for the museum, Governor Rhodes challenged the local community to match, dollar for dollar, the funds to build the facility. Neil Armstrong is the man of the century and we want to perpetuate his achievements here in Ohio, Rhodes said.Wapakoneta residents met that challenge head on. Businesses and individuals alike donated to the cause. Even school children saved their pennies and nickels in order to take part in this once in a lifetime project.When the governor returned to Wapakoneta, he was presented with a check for $528,313.55. Citizens of Wapakoneta had raised over half of the total cost.Plans for the museum were unveiled during the groundbreaking ceremony in 1970. The design was unique. Earth was mounded around the steel reinforced concrete building, giving the building the semblance of being underground. Designed to accommodate the Astro Theater for multimedia film and sound presentations, the central sphere dominates the entire complex. The fifty six feet wide dome enhances the futuristic moon base design.On July 20, 1972, three years to the day after Neil Armstrongs walk on the moon, the Armstrong Air and Space Museum opened to much fanfare. Armstrong himself was present to help open the facility, and Tricia Nixon Cox, standing in for the President, presented moon rocks brought back to Earth from the Apollo 11 mission.As space exploration has evolved, so have the exhibits at the Armstrong Air  Space Museum. But the focus has remained the same to stand not only as a repository of Ohios aeronautical history and a monument to Ohios contribution to aviation and space exploration, but also as a tribute to Ohioan Neil Armstrong, whose one small step for a man was indeed a giant leap for mankind.","500 Apollo Dr, Wapakoneta, OH 45895 9780",Ohio,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1c/b2/c4/6f/a-young-neil-armstrong.jpg,1,4.25,-84.172363,40.56444,55,47,15,3,11
